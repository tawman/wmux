## Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="40%" valign="middle">
<h3>Passive Claude Code integration</h3>
wmux observes Claude Code without changing how it works. Auto-configured hooks in <code>~/.claude/settings.json</code> report agent and tool activity to the sidebar. A CDP proxy on <code>localhost:9222</code> lets Claude Code's native <code>chrome-devtools-mcp</code> plugin control the wmux browser panel directly. Zero setup — everything is auto-injected on startup.

<tr>
<td width="40%" valign="middle">
<h3>Live browser visibility</h3>
When Claude Code browses the web, every action appears in the wmux browser panel in real-time. Navigate, click, type, take screenshots — Claude Code uses its own tools, wmux just shows what's happening. CDP proxy on <code>localhost:9222</code> bridges the connection transparently. Terminal and markdown links open in the panel too.

<td width="40%" valign="middle">
<h3>Notification center</h3>
Panes get a blue ring and tabs light up when agents finish or need attention. Supports OSC 9/99/777, <code>wmux notify</code> CLI, and idle detection. Click the bell icon to see all pending notifications — jump to any with one click. Windows toast notifications and taskbar flash on alerts.

<h3>Saved sessions</h3>
Save your entire workspace layout (splits, working directories, browser URL, shell type) and restore it with one click. Click the save icon in the sidebar footer to name a session, the folder icon to load. On startup, wmux auto-loads your last session — no more manual <code>cd</code> and re-splitting every time.

## Install

### Download (recommended)

Download [wmux-0.7.10-win-x64.zip](https://github.com/amirlehmam/wmux/releases/latest) from GitHub Releases, extract anywhere, and run `wmux.exe`. No installer, no code signing, no admin required.

> **Note:** After extracting, right-click the zip before extracting and select **Unblock** if Windows SmartScreen warns about the executable.

### Updates & security

wmux checks GitHub Releases for updates. Downloaded updates are held in a
quarantine window (3 days by default) before installing, and installs always
require an explicit confirmation click — nothing is applied silently.

Release artifacts are **not yet Authenticode-signed** (SignPath OSS approval is
pending; the CI signing pipeline is wired and activates automatically once the
signing secrets are configured). Until signing lands, security-sensitive or
air-gapped environments can control the updater with environment variables:

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `WMUX_DISABLE_UPDATER=1` | Disable the auto-updater entirely (update manually from GitHub Releases) |
| `WMUX_MIN_RELEASE_AGE_DAYS=N` | Change the quarantine window (default 3 days) |

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirlehmam/wmux.git
cd wmux
npm install
npm run build:main
npm run dev
```

## Why wmux?

I run a lot of Claude Code sessions in parallel. On macOS there is [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux), and it is exactly what I needed — vertical tabs with live metadata, notification rings when agents need attention, a scriptable browser, and a socket API for automation. But I work on Windows, and nothing like it existed.

Windows Terminal has tabs but no notification system. You have to manually check each tab to see if an agent finished or is waiting for input. tmux works in WSL but loses all Windows integration. Electron terminals exist but none focus on the AI agent workflow.

So I built wmux — a visibility layer for AI coding agents. It doesn't replace Claude Code or change how it works. It passively observes and shows you what's happening. A CDP proxy on `localhost:9222` lets Claude Code's native browser tools control the wmux browser panel — you watch every page load, click, and form fill in real-time. Auto-configured hooks in `settings.json` report tool usage and agent activity to the sidebar. When a command finishes or is interrupted, the sidebar dot changes color and you get a notification.

The sidebar shows exactly what each agent is doing — the git branch it is on, the PR it opened, the ports it is listening on, and whether it needs your attention. Shell integration scripts inject themselves into PowerShell, CMD, and Bash sessions and report CWD changes, git branch switches, shell state, and PR status back to the sidebar via a named pipe in real time.

On first launch, wmux auto-configures itself: it injects a minimal informational block into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, adds a `PostToolUse` hook to `~/.claude/settings.json`, installs the wmux-orchestrator Claude Code plugin, and starts a CDP proxy on `localhost:9222`. No API keys needed — everything runs through the user's existing Claude Code session.

Everything is automatable through the `wmux` CLI or the named pipe directly. The protocol matches cmux, so tools built for one work with the other.

## wmux-orchestrator

wmux ships with a bundled Claude Code plugin that enables parallel multi-agent orchestration. Activate it with `/wmux:orchestrate` in any Claude Code session.

**What it does:**
1. Analyzes your codebase and decomposes the task into independent work units
2. Assigns each unit to a Claude Code agent in its own wmux terminal pane
3. Runs agents in dependency-aware waves — later waves wait for earlier ones to finish
4. A reviewer agent inspects the combined output and triggers auto-fixes if needed

**Plugin commands:**
```
/wmux:orchestrate   Decompose and run a complex task across parallel agents
```

The plugin is auto-installed into `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` on wmux startup. It also works without wmux — agents fall back to native Claude Code subagents.

## Shell Integration

wmux automatically injects integration scripts into your shells:

- **PowerShell** — Overrides the `prompt` function. Reports CWD, git branch, dirty state, and shell state (working/done/interrupted) via `NamedPipeClientStream`. Preexec hook via PSReadLine detects when commands start. Background job polls `gh pr view` every 45 seconds.
- **CMD** — Embeds OSC 9 escape sequences in the `PROMPT` variable for CWD reporting.
- **Bash/Zsh (WSL)** — `PROMPT_COMMAND` / `precmd` + `preexec` hooks. Detects interrupts via exit code 130. Communicates via temp file bridge.

Environment variables available in all shells:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `WMUX` | Always `1` inside wmux |
| `WMUX_CLI` | Path to the wmux CLI script |
| `WMUX_SURFACE_ID` | Current surface (tab) ID |
| `WMUX_PIPE` | Named pipe path (`\\.\pipe\wmux`) |

## CLI

The `wmux` CLI communicates with the running app over the named pipe.

```bash
wmux ping                          # Check if wmux is running
wmux notify "Build complete"       # Send a notification
wmux new-workspace --title "API"   # Create a workspace
wmux list-workspaces               # List all workspaces
wmux split --right                 # Split focused pane
wmux send "npm test"               # Send text to terminal
wmux send-key Enter --ctrl         # Send keystroke
wmux read-screen --lines 50        # Read terminal content

# Browser (CDP-powered)
wmux browser open http://localhost:3000
wmux browser snapshot              # Accessibility tree with @eN refs
wmux browser click @e5             # Click element by ref
wmux browser type @e3 "hello"      # Type into input by ref
wmux browser fill @e3 "value"      # Set input value directly
wmux browser screenshot            # Base64 PNG screenshot
wmux browser eval "document.title" # Run JavaScript

# Agents
wmux agent spawn --cmd "claude --resume abc" --label "Research"
wmux agent spawn-batch --json '[{"cmd":"claude","label":"Agent 1"},{"cmd":"claude","label":"Agent 2"}]'
wmux agent list                    # List all agents
wmux agent status <agent-id>       # Check agent status
wmux agent kill <agent-id>         # Kill an agent

wmux tree                          # Workspace / pane / surface hierarchy
```

## Socket API

Connect to `\\.\pipe\wmux` for programmatic control. Two protocols supported:

**V1** (text, used by shell integration):
```
report_pwd <surface_id> <path>
report_git_branch <surface_id> <branch> [dirty]
report_shell_state <surface_id> idle|running|interrupted
notify <surface_id> <text>
ping
```

**V2** (JSON-RPC, used by CLI and automation):
```json
{"method": "workspace.create", "params": {"title": "Agent 1"}}
{"method": "workspace.list", "params": {}}
{"method": "surface.send_text", "params": {"id": "surf-...", "text": "npm test\n"}}
{"method": "surface.read_text", "params": {"id": "surf-...", "lines": 50}}

// Browser control (CDP-powered)
{"method": "browser.navigate", "params": {"url": "http://localhost:3000"}}
{"method": "browser.snapshot", "params": {}}
{"method": "browser.click", "params": {"ref": "@e5"}}
{"method": "browser.screenshot", "params": {"fullPage": true}}
{"method": "browser.eval", "params": {"js": "document.title"}}

// Agent spawning
{"method": "agent.spawn", "params": {"cmd": "claude --resume abc", "label": "Research"}}
{"method": "agent.spawn_batch", "params": {"agents": [...], "strategy": "distribute"}}
{"method": "agent.list", "params": {}}
{"method": "agent.kill", "params": {"agentId": "agent-..."}}

{"method": "system.tree", "params": {}}
```

## Session Restore

On relaunch, wmux restores:

- Window position and size
- Workspace layout (titles, colors, pin state)
- Split pane structure (directions and ratios)
- Working directory per terminal
- Default shell per terminal
- Browser panel URLs
- Active workspace and pane selection

wmux does **not** restore live process state. Active Claude Code, tmux, or vim sessions are not resumed after restart. Shells are respawned fresh in the saved working directories.

## Config

### Terminal themes

Set a global default color scheme in `~/.wmux/config.toml`:

```toml
[terminal]
color_scheme = "Dracula"
```

Override per pane at split time or on the fly:

```bash
wmux split --color-scheme "Tokyo Night"
wmux set-color-scheme "Solarized Dark"
```

Define custom named schemes in Settings > Terminal > Custom Schemes.

### Import from existing terminal configs

wmux reads configuration from:

1. **Windows Terminal** — `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_...\LocalState\settings.json`
2. **Ghostty** — `~/.config/ghostty/config`

Import either via Settings > Terminal > Import. Extracts font family, font size, color scheme, and palette. Default theme is Dracula. 450+ Ghostty themes bundled.

## Architecture

Two-process Electron model. Main process manages PTY spawning (node-pty/ConPTY), named pipe server, CDP browser bridge, port scanning, git/PR polling, notifications, Claude Code context injection, session persistence, and multi-window lifecycle. Renderer process runs React/Zustand with xterm.js (WebGL), recursive split pane layout, and the sidebar.

## Based on cmux

wmux is an independent, from-scratch Windows reimplementation inspired by [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux), the macOS terminal for multitasking. It shares cmux's design philosophy and is wire-compatible with its socket protocol — tools built for cmux's API work with wmux — but it does not reuse cmux's source code.
