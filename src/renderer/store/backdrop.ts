 * on `unfocused-split-opacity`, with the reason spelled out — "because 0 is not
 * useful (it makes the window look very weird), the minimum value is 0.15".
 *
 * Worth being straight about the precedent: neither Ghostty's

 * custom background instead — the old behaviour — meant the background was only
 * ever visible in proportion to how transparent the window was, so at 100% it
 * was perfectly hidden behind the theme's flat grey. Setting a background and
 * seeing no background is not a defensible reading of the setting.
 *

 * CSS, so a translucent gradient layer composites exactly the same way.
