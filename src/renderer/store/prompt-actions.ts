/**
 * The three prompt-log commands (issue #207), as functions of a surface id.
 *
 * Split out of `useKeyboardShortcuts` because there are two entry points, and
 * they were about to disagree. The keyboard path resolves the focused surface
 * from the split tree inside a closure; the command palette resolves it in
 * App.tsx from different state. Everything AFTER that — which store fields to
 * read, what "toggle" means when the preference is off, whether pinning also
 * turns the sticky header on — is one decision each, and one decision belongs
 * in one place.
 *
 * That mattered immediately: the palette hands every action it does not
 * recognise to a `console.log`, so an action wired only into the keyboard table
 * appears in the palette, is selectable, and silently does nothing.

 * Open the outline on this surface, or close it if it is already open here.
 *
 * `promptPrefs.outlineMode` decides WHICH outline. The overlay is the default
 * and what 2.4.0 shipped; `'pane'` gives the same list as a surface in the split
 * tree instead, for the user who wants it open permanently rather than for a
 * glance. `paneContext` is how the caller says where a pane would go — the
 * keyboard and the palette resolve the focused pane differently, and neither of
 * them belongs in here.
