/**
 * Drives window transparency: the desktop showing through the terminal.
 *
 * Two halves have to agree, which is why they live in one hook:
 *
 *  - Main process — a zero-alpha window `backgroundColor`, plus either
 *    `transparent: true` (plain alpha) or a Win11 backdrop material (blurred).
 *  - Renderer — the `wmux-transparent` class, which stops <html>/<body>/#root
 *    painting so the now-transparent window is actually visible through them.
 *
 * The main process reads the same pref off settings.json when it CREATES a
 * window, so launch already comes up right; this hook applies later changes to
 * windows that are already open.
 *
 * Publishes `transparencyNeedsRestart` to the store — entering or leaving
 * plain-alpha mode needs the window rebuilt, because Electron fixes
 * `transparent` at construction and offers no setter. It goes to the store
 * rather than to a caller because Settings renders inside the same tree as
 * App: calling this hook a second time to read the answer would apply every
 * backdrop change twice.
 *
 * Call this exactly once, from App.
