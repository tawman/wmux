/**
 * Claude Code hooks → declared agent state (issue #128).
 *
 * The protocol in agent-state.ts is agent-agnostic: anything that can write a
 * line of JSON to the wmux pipe can drive it. But Claude Code is what most wmux
 * panes actually run, and wmux ALREADY configures four of its hooks in
 * ~/.claude/settings.json (see ensureClaudeHooks in claude-context.ts):
 *
 *   PostToolUse   — a tool just finished running
 *   Notification  — Claude Code wants the user's attention
 *   Stop          — the turn is over
 *   SubagentStop  — one parallel subagent finished
 *
 * Translating those into report_agent calls means the "which pane needs me?"
 * signal works for Claude Code with zero install: no plugin, no wrapper, no
 * opt-in. Other agents (OpenCode, custom harnesses) call the pipe directly.
 *
 * These hooks are lifecycle truth from the agent process itself, which is the
 * same reasoning that made hooks — not output parsing — authoritative for the
 * sidebar's agent lines (issue #81 class).

 * Which event a `hook.event` wire payload denotes, or null for one outside the

 *
 * This exists because the payload does not always say. `wmux-hook.js` is
 * invoked two ways (see its usage block): `--event <Event>` for the lifecycle
 * hooks, and a bare `<tool-name>` for the per-tool PostToolUse entries
 * claude-context.ts installs — and the bare form sends `{ tool }` with NO
 * `event` field. Reading `params.event` directly therefore admits every
 * lifecycle event while silently dropping every PostToolUse, which makes the
 * `case 'PostToolUse'` below unreachable.
 *
 * Since 0.48.0 that is no longer catastrophic — matcher-less `PreToolUse`
 * declares the run at the START of every tool, so a pane still reads `working`.
 * What is lost is the other end: PostToolUse is the event that says a tool
 * FINISHED without the turn ending, and it is the one report that arrives
 * during the stretch between approving a permission prompt and the turn
 * closing. Dropping it also drops the freshness stamp that keeps a long turn
 * inside the trust window, so a turn spent in tracked tools ages out of
 * `working` on nothing but the clock.
 *
 * Resolved here rather than by teaching the hook helper to send `event`: hooks
 * are written into settings.json once at install, so the bare-tool form is
 * already out in every existing config and will keep arriving from helper
 * vintages this build does not control. The main process is the single place
 * that sees every payload regardless of who produced it.

 * Map one Claude Code hook event to a report_agent payload, or null to ignore it.

 * The original four events (issue #128) were all *terminal* — a tool finished, a
 * turn finished, a subagent finished. Nothing said when work STARTED, so the
 * entire stretch between the user pressing Enter and the first tool completing
 * resolved to `idle`, which for a turn that thinks for a minute or runs one long
 * command is most of the turn (issue #151). The three opening events below are
 * the missing half of the lifecycle.
 *
 * ## Who owns the block
 *
 * `runDepth` and `awaitingHuman` are two independent facts, and the tool
 * lifecycle only speaks to the first. A tool starting, finishing, or a subagent
 * finishing says a turn is in flight; NONE of them is evidence that a question
 * already on screen has been answered.
 *
 * That distinction is not academic, because every hook a pane's agent fires —
 * including its background shells and its parallel subagents — carries the same
 * WMUX_SURFACE_ID and lands on the one surface. So an agent that kicks off a
 * background command and then asks the user a question is, from wmux's side,
 * a pane that is blocked AND busy at the same time. That is a legitimate state,
 * and `resolveState` in agent-state.ts already renders it correctly: `blocked`
 * outranks `runDepth > 0`, so the pane says "needs you" while the work continues
 * underneath. What broke it was these events retracting the flag on the way past.
 *
 * So a block is ended only by something that actually knows a human dealt with it:
 *
 *   - `UserPromptSubmit`  — the human replied
 *   - `Stop`              — the turn ended, so there is nothing left to answer
 *   - `noteHumanInput`    — the human typed in the pane (agent-state.ts)
 *   - an explicit `report-agent --unblocked` from the agent
 *
 * The cost is that a prompt answered through `wmux answer-agent` — a relay, not
 * a local keystroke — keeps saying "needs you" until the turn ends rather than
 * until the next tool. That is answerAgent's rule 3 working as designed: the
 * agent confirms, wmux does not assume. `answeredAt` is what the UI shows in the
 * meantime ("sent — waiting for the agent"). A block that lingers is visible and
 * self-correcting; one that vanishes while the agent is still stuck is the bug.

    // input" idle nudge it arms when a turn ends.
    //
    // Only the first is `blocked`. "Needs you" claims there is something to
    // answer, and after a turn has ended there is nothing — the pane is idle,
    // and saying otherwise is how a pane nobody has touched starts asking for
    // attention a minute after it goes quiet. Observed exactly that way: Stop
    // at T, nudge at T+60s, on a session that had just been /clear'd and left
    // alone. /clear wipes the transcript but not Claude Code's idle timer, so
    // the nudge landed on an empty conversation and the pane said "Needs you".
    //
    // The two are told apart by STATE, not by the message text. Sniffing the
    // text was considered and rejected: it would stop working the day Claude
    // Code rewords a prompt, and would fail in the dangerous direction (a real
    // permission prompt read as "not blocked"). Run depth cannot drift that way
    // — a prompt can only occur inside a live turn, and both UserPromptSubmit
    // and PreToolUse declare depth 1 before Claude Code can ask anything, so
    // depth 0 at Notification time means the turn is over, which means nudge.
    //
    // Gated on `turnStartTracked` because that argument only holds while the
    // opening hooks are firing. A settings.json written before 0.48.0 carries
    // only the four terminal hooks, sits at depth 0 through an entire turn, and
    // would read every real prompt as a nudge — the dangerous direction again.
    // Until wmux has seen one opening event it declines to draw the distinction
    // and parks the pane for both, exactly as it did before.
    //
    // Gated on `known` for the same reason at the pane level. A pane wmux holds
    // no record for has a depth of 0 by DEFAULT, not by observation — which is
    // what a main process restarted in the middle of someone's turn sees, and
    // what a prompt arriving before any other hook on that pane sees. Reading
    // that as "the turn is over" would swallow a real prompt.
    //
    // This is the other half of noteHumanInput's bargain in agent-state.ts.
    // That code clears a block when the human types, and leans on "if the
    // keystroke didn't satisfy the agent, the 60-second nudge puts the pane
    // back to asking" — which is only sound if the nudge cannot ALSO invent a

    // is still open). See the block-ownership note above.

    // produced the loudest half of issue #151. Subagent hooks inherit the
    // parent's WMUX_SURFACE_ID, so all of them report to ONE pane: three
    // subagents' PostToolUse events each pin the depth to the absolute value 1,
    // and then the FIRST SubagentStop drains it to 0 — the pane reads `idle`
    // with the parent and two siblings still working. A refcount only survives
    // contact with reality when every increment is paired, and these are not
    // paired; the parent's `Stop` is the pairing, and it is already decisive.
    //
    // Fixing that by asserting an unconditional depth of 1 rested on a premise
    // that measurement does not support: that Claude Code fires the parent's
    // `Stop` only after every subagent has stopped. It does not. Traced at the
    // hook helper on two independent panes, the wire order is `Stop` first and
    // `SubagentStop` 1.8-2.2s LATER — so the unconditional form resurrected the
    // very run `Stop` had just ended, and the pane sat on "Running" until the
    // 15-minute trust window with the agent idle at its prompt.
    //
    // The wall-clock gate in agent-state.ts cannot catch it, and that is the
    // point worth remembering: it drops reports that are OLDER than what has
    // been accepted, which is the right defence against two hook processes
    // racing to the pipe. This is not a race. The trailing report is genuinely
    // newer; it is the EVENT ORDER that is counter-intuitive, and no amount of
    // timestamp discipline fixes a report that is late by design.
    //
    // Reading the current depth is what separates the two situations, using the
    // one fact that distinguishes them: the parent's `Stop` has already zeroed
    // it. So a subagent finishing inside a live turn holds that turn open, and
    // a subagent finishing after the turn ended says nothing at all. Declining
    // to report also leaves the freshness stamp alone, so the 60s idle
    // `Notification` that follows still sees depth 0 and is correctly read as a
    // nudge rather than a prompt — the resurrection defeated that gate too, and
    // the pane went on to claim "Needs you" with nothing to answer.
    //
    // `known` is checked for the same reason `Notification` checks it: a pane
    // wmux holds no record for has a depth of 0 by DEFAULT, not by observation.
