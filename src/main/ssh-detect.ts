/**
 * ssh-detect.ts — decide whether a terminal surface is currently sitting inside
 * an interactive ssh session, and to which host.
 *
 * Three sources feed one per-surface cache, in precedence order:
 *
 *   1. Managed  — the surface was created by `wmux ssh user@host`, so its
 *                 `shell` string IS the ssh command line. Authoritative, free.
 *   2. Reported — the shell-integration preexec hook told us the user just ran
 *                 an ssh command. Instant, covers the typed `ssh host` case,
 *                 cleared when the shell returns to its prompt.
 *   3. Probed   — a background `Win32_Process` sweep finds an `ssh.exe`
 *                 descended from the pane's PTY. Windows cannot tell whether
 *                 that process owns the foreground, so this source may only
 *                 corroborate one of the two authoritative sources above.
 *
 * (1) and (3) are the two sources cmux has — its `.workspaceRemote` and its
 * `ps -t <tty>` foreground probe. (2) has no cmux counterpart and exists purely
 * because of a platform difference: on macOS `ps` answers in milliseconds, so
 * cmux can afford to probe at paste time. On Windows the only way to read
 * another process's command line from Node is a PowerShell CIM query costing
 * ~550ms, so (1) and (2) are latency caches over (3).
