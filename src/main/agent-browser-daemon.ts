/**
 * The agent-browser observability dashboard process.
 *
 * Refcounted by the number of live agent-mode surfaces: first acquire starts
 * it, last release stops it.
 *
 * ── Adopt, never fight ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * If :4848 already answers when we go to start, a human (or another wmux)
 * started it. We use it and record `adopted`. An adopted dashboard is NEVER
 * stopped — not on the last release, not on shutdown. wmux did not start it, so
 * stopping it is not wmux's to do, and killing a dashboard the user is watching
 * in their own Chrome would be a genuinely baffling bug to report.
 *
 * Process control is injected so this is testable with no child processes.
 *
 * ── Scope: this only guards the DASHBOARD port ───────────────────────────
 * `probe` answers one question — is something already listening on the
 * dashboard's port (4848)? It says nothing about the PER-SESSION stream ports
 * that `agent-browser-session.ts`'s `SessionRegistry` hands out (9300+):
 * that registry tracks only the ports it has itself allocated. Bindability of
 * those is `SessionRegistry.ensureBindable`'s job — it probes each candidate
 * with a real `listen` before committing, because a squatting process (including
 * an orphan from a previous wmux) can hold a port the registry believes is free.
 * Do not assume `probe()` here covers any of that; it answers about 4848 only.
