/**
 * The process-wide agent-browser singletons, and the real hooks behind them.
 *
 * This module exists for ONE reason: there must be exactly one
 * `SessionRegistry` and exactly one `DashboardDaemon` in the process, and every
 * consumer must reach the same pair. Both are stateful in ways a second copy
 * silently corrupts — the registry allocates stream ports from a set only it
 * knows about (two registries hand the same 9300 to two surfaces), and the
 * daemon refcounts a real OS process (two daemons each believe they own the
 * dashboard, and the first `release()` to reach zero stops it out from under
 * the other). So routing (`v2-browser.ts`), lifecycle and teardown all import
 * from here rather than constructing their own.
 *
 * It is deliberately a wiring module and nothing else: the interesting logic
 * lives in `agent-browser-session.ts` and `agent-browser-daemon.ts`, both of
 * which are pure/injected so they stay testable with no ports and no child
 * processes. What is added here — and only here — is the impure half.

 *
 *   • agent-browser exposes no per-session PID. `session list` returns bare

 *     sessions the user created by hand — the exact boundary the `wmux-`
 *     prefix rule exists to protect.
 *   • The daemon is SHARED. The live hang was triggered by a daemon version
 *     mismatch restart, i.e. by the process that fronts several sessions at
 *     once. Killing it to free one session takes the others with it.
 *   • Because sessions are ephemeral, a survivor is not permanent damage: it
 *     has no live surface, so the next launch's `reconcileOrphanSessions`
 *     classifies it as garbage and closes it. The cost of waiting is one
 *     leaked Chrome until then; the cost of guessing a PID is somebody else's
