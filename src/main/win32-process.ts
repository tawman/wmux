 * upload (`ssh-detect.ts`). Both had grown their own copy of the same
 * invocation, which is how the security-relevant part — resolving
 * `powershell.exe` by absolute path so a writeable PATH directory cannot shadow
 * it — ended up stated twice.
 *
 * `Get-CimInstance` rather than `wmic`, which is being removed from Windows.
 * The generated command deliberately contains no double quotes, so nothing
 * depends on how `execFile` escapes the argument.
