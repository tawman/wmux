/**
 * Every wmux pipe round trip used to carry ~60 ms of dead wait, and none of it
 * was the server thinking.
 *
 * The clients (the CLI's sendV1/sendV2, the hook helper) wrote their one request
 * and then `socket.end()`ed — a half-close. On a Windows named pipe libuv answers
 * a half-close by arming a 50 ms `eof_timeout` (libuv src/win/pipe.c) before it
 * will report EOF to the reader, and since wmux's server never closed its side,
 * the client sat on that timer before it could exit: `wmux ping` measured 96 ms
 * against a raw pipe that answers in 1 ms, a hook process 95 ms. With
 * destroy-on-reply: 36 ms and 37 ms.
 *
 * These tests pin the CLIENT half against a server that behaves like the OLD
 * wmux — answers, never closes — because that is what an installed wmux is until
 * it is upgraded, and the hook helper on disk is often older than the wmux it
 * talks to. The compiled scripts under resources/cli are exercised, not the
 * TypeScript: those are the bytes a hook actually runs.
